I am thrilled to share "Crayo AI," our team project for Project 3 of Week 3 at the Headstarter Fellowship. This collaborative effort resulted in an innovative project featuring:
- AUTH login
- User-friendly UI
- AI chatbot
- Multi-language support

The project presented a challenging level 3 difficulty that pushed us to deliver our best work. My contributions included:
- Developing the login system
- Designing the UI
Maryam Arif enhanced the UI of the landing page and chatbot page. Muhammad Rayan led the Gemini API integration, while Kanika Khosla implemented multi-language support.
